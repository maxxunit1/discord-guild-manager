# DISCORD GUILD MANAGER CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# Copy this file to .env and adjust values
# Скопируйте этот файл в .env и настройте значения

# ============================================
# PROCESSING RANGE
# ============================================
# Which lines to process from data files
# For example: if you have 100 accounts and want to process
# only accounts 10-30, set START_LINE=10 and END_LINE=30
# To process all accounts, set START_LINE=1 and END_LINE=9999
# First line number to process (minimum: 1)
START_LINE=1        
# Last line number to process (use 9999 for all)
END_LINE=9999       

# ============================================
# PERFORMANCE SETTINGS
# ============================================
# Number of parallel threads for processing accounts
# Higher value = faster processing but more resource usage
# Recommended: 3-5 for normal use, 1 for testing
# How many accounts to process simultaneously
THREAD_COUNT=3      

# ============================================
# RANDOMIZATION SETTINGS
# ============================================
# Randomize the order of account processing
# Set to True to process accounts in random order (recommended for stealth)
# Set to False to process accounts sequentially
# True or False
RANDOM_START=False

# ============================================
# DELAYS BETWEEN ACCOUNTS (in seconds)
# ============================================
# Random delay between starting each account
# The script will wait random time between MIN and MAX values
# This helps avoid rate limiting and detection
# Minimum delay in seconds
ACCOUNT_DELAY_MIN=1     
# Maximum delay in seconds
ACCOUNT_DELAY_MAX=5    
 
# ============================================
# DISCORD API DELAYS (in seconds)
# ============================================
# Delay between Discord API requests for the same account
# Helps avoid rate limiting (429 errors)
# Minimum delay between requests
DISCORD_REQUEST_DELAY_MIN=5    
# Maximum delay between requests
DISCORD_REQUEST_DELAY_MAX=10   

# ============================================
# PROFILE FILTERS (optional)
# ============================================
# Leave empty to process all profiles
# Or specify which profiles to include/exclude
# Format: comma-separated numbers, e.g., "1,2,3,4,5"
# Process only these profiles (empty = all)
ALLOW_PROFILE_NUMBERS=      
# Skip these profiles (empty = none)
SKIP_PROFILE_NUMBERS=
